# Hall Booking System - White Label Platform

**Enterprise-grade white-label booking system for individual venues with zero double-bookings and flexible payment options**

Designed as a **white-label solution** where each venue gets their own branded booking interface. Built for Parbhani hall MVP, architected to scale as SaaS serving 100+ independent venue instances.

## 🎯 Core Concept

### White-Label Architecture
- **One Venue Per Instance**: Each deployment serves a single venue
- **Custom Branding**: Venue name, colors, and contact info
- **Multi-Day Booking**: Customers select one or multiple full days
- **Simple Flow**: Calendar → Event Details → Login → Payment → Confirmation

### NOT a Marketplace
This is explicitly **NOT** a marketplace platform. Each venue operates independently with their own:
- Branded interface
- Booking calendar  
- Payment settings
- Customer base

## 🏗️ System Architecture

This system solves the **double-booking problem** through database-level exclusion constraints while providing a modern, scalable API for hall bookings, user management, and **revolutionary flexible payment processing** that serves all types of venues from cash-only to fully digital.

|---------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Cash Only** | 5% | Zero tech barrier, manual confirmation | Traditional halls, family businesses |
| **Cash + Deposit** | 7% | Small online deposit + cash balance | Progressive traditional venues |
| **Hybrid Flexible** | 8% | Customer chooses payment method | Modern venues serving all customers |
| **Full Online** | 10% | All payments online, instant confirmation | Tech-savvy venues |
| **Marketplace** | 15% | Platform handles everything | Premium full-service venues |
